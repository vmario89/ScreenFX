{"name":"ScreenFX","tagline":"A plugin library for JavaFX 8 adding features for resizing and arranging stage windows for multiple screens","body":"### Editor's note\r\nThis tool is inspired originally by the tool \"Asus Multiframe\" which was only capable to handle two screens.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nThis library is written for JavaFX 8 and was built with JDK 1.8.0-b121. If you compile the sources with JDK 1.7 it could mabye work 100% without any trouble.\r\n\r\n### How it works?\r\n\r\n### How to use?\r\nThe installation of ScreenFX is very easy. All you need is to call:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nButton button = new Button(\"Show ScreenFX\");\r\nScreenFX screenFX = new ScreenFX();\r\nscreenFX.install(button);\r\n</pre>\r\nIf you want more access to ScreenFX you can adjust some properties (as listed in the features list):\r\n<pre>\r\nButton button = new Button(\"Show ScreenFX\");\r\nProperties sfxProperties = ScreenFX.getScreenFXProperties();\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"UIConventionOverride\", new Boolean(false));\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"allowTooltips\", new Boolean(true));\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"exitDelayTime\", new Long(200l));\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"popupKeyCodeCombination\", new KeyCodeCombination(KeyCode.D, KeyCombination.SHIFT_DOWN));\r\nscreenFX.setScreenFXProperties(sfxProperties);\r\nscreenFX.install(button);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/3Bq9nR/384acc8dba.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/CyzLs8/8a2f142ed9.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/LYPK5Z/20203b1f6e.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/sRjc2Q/47894edb35.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/NEe4sB/6eae86a6d4.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/GymRZL/51ff5c1635.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/NwIPzY/f170eaedaf.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/6kWHVC/afa4d056b9.png)\r\n![ ](http://image-upload.de/image/PhLADc/1e51a41326.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* compatible up to 9 screens (cubic layout, master screen in middle of cube)\r\n* language support german + english\r\n* should be compatible with all operating systems (tested only Windows 7/8/8.1)\r\n* includes calculations for maximum real screen size or the screen size respecting elements like windows taskbar which reduce the area for resizing windows\r\n* global configuration options which are:\r\n\t* change key combination\r\n \t* enable/disable tooltips\r\n\t* enable/disable overriding of ui conventions (if enabled you can resize the window even it is in fullscreen mode)\r\n\t* add custom icon set\r\n\t* add custom language resource\r\n\t* change the delay time to exit ScreenFX when moving mouse out\r\n* configuration is global so you can access one static class to controll all the ScreenFX containers\r\n* for each stage you can allow an own ScreenFX container separately\r\n* resize window to screen halfs or quarters\r\n* put window to screen edges or corners\r\n* set to fullscreen\r\n* maximize window in width, height or both\r\n* jump the window to each screen you want\r\n* access ScreenFX through key combination (default: ctrl + s) or via button pressing (you need a JavaFX component which extends the class ButtonBase)\r\n* you do not need to initialize the tool manually. you only have to install the tool once per stage. therefore minimum requirement is that the stage contains a minimum of one node\r\n\r\n### To do\r\n\r\n### License","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
