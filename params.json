This popup has abilities to handle positioning and resizing events of each stage. Please read further to learn how to use.\r\n\r\n![quartered stages example](http://image-upload.de/image/GGJRtP/b8a617e1ee.jpg)\r\n\r\n![taskbar on another side and program which reduces the real size of desktop](http://image-upload.de/image/sZ3U20/7d59059303.png)\r\n\r\n![and another configuration example](http://image-upload.de/image/pLbFmD/ddaed8fd3f.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Editor's note\r\nThis tool is inspired originally by the tool \"Asus Multiframe\" which was only capable to handle two screens. As the tool multiframe does not work an java applications and because of the screen number limitation i decided to write my own tool box.\r\n\r\n## Project requirements\r\nThis library is written for JavaFX 8 and was built with JDK 1.8.0-b121. If you compile the sources with JDK 1.7 it could mabye work 100% without any trouble.\r\n\r\n## How it works?\r\nScreenFX will read out your current system hardware configuration for screen devices and will create a grid layout:\r\n\r\n![The system layout](http://image-upload.de/image/CyzLs8/8a2f142ed9.png) ![The grid layout read from system configuration](http://image-upload.de/image/3Bq9nR/384acc8dba.png)\r\n\r\nAs you can see the layout reacts on the total count of screens. If only one screen is available, ScreenFX will only show one (the default colored main screen #1). If more screens are installed all secondary screens get a darker color than screen #1.\r\n\r\n![1 screen](http://image-upload.de/image/NwIPzY/f170eaedaf.png)\r\n![2 screens](http://image-upload.de/image/NEe4sB/6eae86a6d4.png)\r\n\r\nThere's also an integrated convention which disallows the user to resize and arrange the window if it is pushed to fullscreen mode:\r\n\r\n![User interface convention: no abilities in fullscreen mode](http://image-upload.de/image/LYPK5Z/20203b1f6e.png)\r\n\r\n## How to use?\r\nThe installation of ScreenFX is very easy. You do not need to initialize the tool manually. You only have to install the tool once per stage. Therefore the only requirement is that the stage contains a total minimum of one node. Tie the screenfx-current.jar into your JavaFX project and call the function like this:\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nButton button = new Button(\"Show ScreenFX\");\r\nScreenFX screenFX = new ScreenFX();\r\nscreenFX.install(button);\r\n</pre>\r\nIf you want more access to ScreenFX you can adjust some properties (as listed in the features list):\r\n<pre>\r\nButton button = new Button(\"Show ScreenFX\");\r\nProperties sfxProperties = ScreenFX.getScreenFXProperties();\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"UIConventionOverride\", new Boolean(false));\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"allowTooltips\", new Boolean(true));\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"exitDelayTime\", new Long(200l));\r\nsfxProperties.put(\"popupKeyCodeCombination\", \r\n\tnew KeyCodeCombination(KeyCode.D, KeyCombination.SHIFT_DOWN));\r\nscreenFX.setScreenFXProperties(sfxProperties);\r\nscreenFX.install(button);\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nScreenFX can be used with normal builder-like source code as well as using with FXML and a controller class. You can directly install ScreenFX into the initialize() method of your controller. See the example distributed with the library.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n### General\r\n* compatible up to 9 screens (cubic layout, master screen in middle of cube)\r\n* standard language support german + english\r\n* should be compatible with all operating systems (tested only Windows 7/8/8.1)\r\n\r\n### Tooltips\r\n![positioning and resizing](http://image-upload.de/image/sRjc2Q/47894edb35.png)\r\n![additional functions](http://image-upload.de/image/6kWHVC/afa4d056b9.png)\r\n![include taskbar yes or no](http://image-upload.de/image/GymRZL/51ff5c1635.png)\r\n![screen information](http://image-upload.de/image/PhLADc/1e51a41326.png)\r\n\r\n### Functions\r\n* includes calculations for maximum real screen size or the screen size respecting elements like windows taskbar which reduce the area for resizing windows\r\n* global configuration options which are:\r\n\t* change key combination\r\n \t* enable/disable tooltips\r\n\t* enable/disable overriding of ui conventions (if enabled you can resize the window even it is in fullscreen mode)\r\n\t* add custom icon set\r\n\t* add custom language resource\r\n\t* change the delay time to exit ScreenFX when moving mouse out\r\n* configuration is global so you can access one static class to controll all the ScreenFX containers\r\n* for each stage you can allow an own ScreenFX container separately\r\n* resize window to screen halfs or quarters\r\n* put window to screen edges or corners\r\n* set to fullscreen (fully fullscreen or fullscreen showing taskbar)\r\n* maximize window in width, height or both\r\n* jump the window to each screen you want\r\n* access ScreenFX through key combination (default: ctrl + s) or via button pressing (you need a JavaFX component which extends the class ButtonBase)\r\n\r\n## To do\r\nCurrently there are some features to change/add:\r\n* create an algorithm to break the current 9 screen cubic layout to a more common flexible layout\r\n* fix the checkbox height - instead of setting the font size to 10px there must be a way to style the box from checkbox in its width/height separately without styling it's label\r\n* create a stylesheet which contains all the styles, effects, filters and hoverings which are currently done with hard coded event handlers\r\n* add some functionality to restore window positions\r\n* change the time a tooltip is displayed before it's going to automatically hides\r\n* put some try-catch methods into code to grant more stability\r\n* fix issue that taskbar checkbox does not work when popup appears a second time\r\n* save taskbar checkbox value from last usage into properties so that next popup will take last check values\r\n* add javadoc\r\n\r\n## License\r\n_I would appreciate if somebody contributes to my source code. Help me making it even more functional, more stable, add some style sheets, create additional language support, fix spelling errors and  bugs in source code, etc. - Thanks, Mario Voigt - 19.01.2014_\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n/*\r\n * ScreenFX - A plugin library for JavaFX 8 adding features for resizing \r\n * and arranging stage windows on a multiple screen hardware configuration\r\n * \r\n * Copyright (C) 2014 Mario Voigt \r\n * Ulmenstr. 35 \r\n * 09112 Chemnitz \r\n * Germany \r\n * vmario@hrz.tu-chemnitz.de\r\n * \r\n * This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n * the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n * (at your option) any later version.\r\n * \r\n * This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n * but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n * MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
