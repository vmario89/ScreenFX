<h2>
<a name="what-is-screenfx" class="anchor" href="#what-is-screenfx"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is ScreenFX?</h2>

<p>ScreenFX is a library for JavaFX 8 which allows you to install a small and lightweight popup container to your application stages. This popup has abilities to handle positioning and resizing events of each stage. Please read further to learn how to use.</p>

<h2>
<a name="editors-note" class="anchor" href="#editors-note"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Editor's note</h2>

<p>This tool is inspired originally by the tool "Asus Multiframe" which was only capable to handle two screens. As the tool multiframe does not work an java applications and because of the screen number limitation i decided to write my own tool box.</p>

<h2>
<a name="project-requirements" class="anchor" href="#project-requirements"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project requirements</h2>

<p>This library is written for JavaFX 8 and was built with JDK 1.8.0-b121. If you compile the sources with JDK 1.7 it could mabye work 100% without any trouble.</p>

<h2>
<a name="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works?</h2>

<p>ScreenFX will read out your current system hardware configuration for screen devices and will create a grid layout:</p>

<p><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/CyzLs8/8a2f142ed9.png" alt="The system layout"><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/3Bq9nR/384acc8dba.png" alt="The grid layout read from system configuration"></p>

<p>As you can see the layout reacts on the total count of screens. If only one screen is available, ScreenFX will only show one (the default colored main screen #1). If more screens are installed all secondary screens get a darker color than screen #1.</p>

<p><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/NwIPzY/f170eaedaf.png" alt="1 screen"><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/NEe4sB/6eae86a6d4.png" alt="2 screens"></p>

<p>There's also an integrated convention which disallows the user to resize and arrange the window if it is pushed to fullscreen mode:</p>

<p><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/LYPK5Z/20203b1f6e.png" alt="User interface convention: no abilities in fullscreen mode"></p>

<h2>
<a name="how-to-use" class="anchor" href="#how-to-use"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to use?</h2>

<p>The installation of ScreenFX is very easy. You do not need to initialize the tool manually. You only have to install the tool once per stage. Therefore the only requirement is that the stage contains a total minimum of one node. Tie the screenfx-current.jar into your JavaFX project and call the function like this:</p>

<pre>
Button button = new Button("Show ScreenFX");
ScreenFX screenFX = new ScreenFX();
screenFX.install(button);
</pre>

<p>If you want more access to ScreenFX you can adjust some properties (as listed in the features list):</p>

<pre>
Button button = new Button("Show ScreenFX");
Properties sfxProperties = ScreenFX.getScreenFXProperties();
sfxProperties.put("UIConventionOverride", new Boolean(false));
sfxProperties.put("allowTooltips", new Boolean(true));
sfxProperties.put("exitDelayTime", new Long(200l));
sfxProperties.put("popupKeyCodeCombination", 
    new KeyCodeCombination(KeyCode.D, KeyCombination.SHIFT_DOWN));
screenFX.setScreenFXProperties(sfxProperties);
screenFX.install(button);
</pre>

<p>ScreenFX can be used with normal builder-like source code as well as using with FXML and a controller class. You can directly install ScreenFX into the initialize() method of your controller. See the example distributed with the library.</p>

<h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<h3>
<a name="general" class="anchor" href="#general"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General</h3>

<ul>
<li>compatible up to 9 screens (cubic layout, master screen in middle of cube)</li>
<li>standard language support german + english</li>
<li>should be compatible with all operating systems (tested only Windows 7/8/8.1)</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="tooltips" class="anchor" href="#tooltips"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tooltips</h3>

<p><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/sRjc2Q/47894edb35.png" alt="positioning and resizing"><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/6kWHVC/afa4d056b9.png" alt="additional functions"><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/GymRZL/51ff5c1635.png" alt="include taskbar yes or no"><img src="http://image-upload.de/image/PhLADc/1e51a41326.png" alt="screen information"></p>

<h3>
<a name="functions" class="anchor" href="#functions"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Functions</h3>

<ul>
<li>includes calculations for maximum real screen size or the screen size respecting elements like windows taskbar which reduce the area for resizing windows</li>
<li>global configuration options which are:

<ul>
<li>change key combination</li>
<li>enable/disable tooltips</li>
<li>enable/disable overriding of ui conventions (if enabled you can resize the window even it is in fullscreen mode)</li>
<li>add custom icon set</li>
<li>add custom language resource</li>
<li>change the delay time to exit ScreenFX when moving mouse out</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>configuration is global so you can access one static class to controll all the ScreenFX containers</li>
<li>for each stage you can allow an own ScreenFX container separately</li>
<li>resize window to screen halfs or quarters</li>
<li>put window to screen edges or corners</li>
<li>set to fullscreen (fully fullscreen or fullscreen showing taskbar)</li>
<li>maximize window in width, height or both</li>
<li>jump the window to each screen you want</li>
<li>access ScreenFX through key combination (default: ctrl + s) or via button pressing (you need a JavaFX component which extends the class ButtonBase)</li>
</ul><h2>
<a name="to-do" class="anchor" href="#to-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>To do</h2>

<p>Currently there are some features to change/add:</p>

<ul>
<li>fix issue that when a screen gets removed from hardware while ScreenFX is shown there are some ugly nonlocatable exceptions thrown. These exceptions are thrown casually by some effects like Glow and ColorAdjust</li>
<li>add resize effect:<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17306981/how-do-i-create-a-resize-animation-for-javafx-stage">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17306981/how-do-i-create-a-resize-animation-for-javafx-stage</a>
</li>
<li>method to directly install to stage instead of node</li>
<li>function to check if a node on which ScreenFX was installed, removed/became disabled/...</li>
<li>add key combination to directly resize the window (1 instead of 2 mouseclicks)</li>
<li>add key combination to directly enabled/disable taskbar include checkbox</li>
<li>remove the feature that ScreenFX buttons get disabled in fullscreen mode. Instead reenforce normal displaying and then set size/position</li>
<li>create an algorithm to break the current 9 screen cubic layout to a more common flexible layout</li>
<li>fix the checkbox height - instead of setting the font size to 10px there must be a way to style the box from checkbox in its width/height separately without styling it's label</li>
<li>create a stylesheet which contains all the styles, effects, filters and hoverings which are currently done with hard coded event handlers</li>
<li>add some functionality to save/restore windows (position, size, visible state, stage style, fullscreenproperty, resizable true/false)</li>
<li>modification tool for live changing of resize yes/no, change StageStyle, ...</li>
<li>change the time a tooltip is displayed before it's going to automatically hides</li>
<li>put some try-catch methods into code to grant more stability</li>
<li>fix issue that taskbar checkbox does not work when popup appears a second time</li>
<li>fix fullscreen issue: if the primary stage is in fullscreen and another stage gets into fullscreen the first hides and does not reappear -&gt; disable fullscreen buttons for all other screen if one of the screens has set active fullscreen property. There also needs to be checked if the window is still visible if it was visible before</li>
<li>save taskbar checkbox value from last usage into properties so that next popup will take last check values</li>
<li>add javadoc</li>

<p><em>I would appreciate if somebody contributes to my source code. Help me making it even more functional, more stable, add some style sheets, create additional language support, fix spelling errors and  bugs in source code, etc. - Thanks, Mario Voigt - 19.01.2014</em></p>
